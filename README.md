# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
For this project Steve wanted us to create a workbook that was capable of analyzing data about certain stocks at the click of a button. Once we did that we were interested in finding out if we could produce the same outcome for the entire stock market. We did this by refactoring the code we wrote for Steve. We were interested in seeing if we refactored our code to loop through the entire dataset once if our runtime would be faster or not.
## Results
What we can conclude after refactoring our code is that the run time did decrease for both 2018 and 2017. This was possible because in our new refactored code there were less steps that had to be done by the computer. Essentially, we made our code more efficient. (insert run times). Another part of the data that we can compare is the returns for the stocks we analyzed. We can see that all but one of the stocks in 2017 (TERP) had positive returns. However, in 2018, all the stocks but two (ENPH & RUN) had negative returns suggesting that in 2018 the stock market was not as good to invest in as it was in 2017. (Insert images)
